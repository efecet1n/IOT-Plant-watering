# Smart Plant Watering And Monitoring System

Our project is a smart plant watering system we’re planning for simple 
houseplants, using a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W microcontroller. It will 
include a soil moisture sensor to check if the soil is dry and it will give 
a analog signal between 0 and 4.2 volts. We’ll also add a KY-018 
LDR sensor to measure if the plant is getting enough light, so we 
know the plant receiving righ amount of daylight. A DHT11 sensor 
will track temperature (up to 50°C) and humidity (20-80%) to make 
sure wather conditions are right. A tiny water pump, running on 5 
volts will water the plants from a small tank when needed. The 
Raspberry Pi Pico 2W will get power from a USB cable, But in 
advanced projects, lithium batteries can also be used. The Wi-Fi 
feature on the Pico 2W is something we plan to use too like checking 
soil or light levels from Blynk app.
